# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- The root `flake.nix` defines inputs and exports `nixosConfigurations` for each host; treat it as the authoritative entry point.
- Host profiles live under `hosts/<hostname>` (e.g. `hosts/gregor/default.nix`) and compose hardware profiles with shared modules; add new hosts here.
- Shared system modules belong in `modules/core` or `modules/desktop`; Home Manager modules go under `modules/home/<profile>`.
- Assets for docs and screenshots are stored in `.github/assets`; keep generated artifacts out of version control.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `nix flake update` refreshes inputs; run before large upgrades to sync `flake.lock`.
- `nixos-rebuild dry-run --flake .#gregor` validates host builds without applying changes; swap host name as needed.
- `nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#gregor` builds and activates the target system.
- `nixos-rebuild test --flake .#vm` is preferred for verifying experimental hosts.
- `home-manager switch --flake .#jwilger@gregor` applies user profiles when developing Home Manager modules.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Format Nix files with `nixpkgs-fmt` (2-space indent, trailing commas on multi-line attribute sets, alphabetical option ordering).
- Name host directories with lowercase hostnames (`gregor`, `vm`) and keep module filenames as `default.nix`; add submodules using hyphenated directories when logical (`modules/home/zellij`).
- Keep option names descriptive and match upstream NixOS option casing; prefer inline comments sparingly to justify deviations.

## Testing Guidelines
- `nix flake check` should pass before publishing; it catches evaluation and formatting regressions.
- Use `nixos-rebuild dry-run` for smoke tests and capture the summary in PRs when changes touch core modules.
- Validate Home Manager updates with `home-manager build --flake .#jwilger@vm` to avoid surprises.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow the existing short, imperative commit style (`chore: cleanup`, `Update cosmic desktop theme`) and keep scope narrow; group lockfile bumps separately.
- Reference related issues in the body when available and note host(s) impacted in the PR description.
- Include command outputs (`nix flake check`, `nixos-rebuild dry-run`) in PR discussions, plus screenshots when UI or theme assets in `.github/assets` change.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Never commit secrets or unencrypted private keys; prefer NixOS `sops` or environment variables stored outside the repo.
- Review firewall and network changes in `hosts/<hostname>` carefully to maintain parity across hosts.
